# Systems and Data Projects

Technical operational systems and data analysis fundamentals with reproducible problem-solving alongside long-term systems development work with scientific research and discovery perspective. 

## Projects

### 1. Python Log Analysis
Processes simulated authentication logs to detect abnormal login activity. Features include:

- Failed login aggregation and top failing IP detection
- User flagging based on configurable thresholds
- External IP identification
- Hourly time-based activity variation
- Burst detection within short windows
- JSON export of analysis results for operational use

The dataset is synthetic for demonstration purposes.

### 2. SQL IT Inventory
Demonstrates relational database design and query development for IT asset inventory:

- Schema creation (`schema.sql`)
- Seed data setup (`seed_data.sql`)
- Example queries (`queries.sql`)

Both projects illustrate structured problem-solving, operational awareness, and foundational systems / data skills.

## Possible extensions

* Real-time monitoring
* Alert system
* Dashboard integration
* Data validation rules

## Notes

- Thresholds and parameters in Python log analysis are configurable.
- All datasets are synthetic; no real user or infrastructure data is included.
- Built as concise, operational proofs-of-work for early systems / data portfolio review.
